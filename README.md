Golang library for general utility functions that are common in other languages.

## Install

```bash
go get -u github.com/teamjorge/core-go/v1
```

## Overview

This library aims to provide general functions that can be found in many other languages. No reflection is used and all functions are statically typed. Concepts covered will include:

* Sets

The package is versioned to `v1` for now due to:

* Generics for golang being on the horizon
* In case there are breaking changes introduced (extremely low risk)
